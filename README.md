# Second Game Attempt
 My second attempt at making strategy, turn-base, rogue-like game.
 Altough better, this verion still did not achieved what I was looking for, in terms of gameplay.
 Again, the apperance is not the best, as it is programmer art, most reused from previous attempt.
 Definitely an improvement, but alas, not enough.
 This one is far from being finished, as it was abandoned quite early in development.

 As of last one, I do not plan on working on it any further. Will try again, until I find a version that works for me.
